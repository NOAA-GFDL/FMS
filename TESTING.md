# Unit Testing

FMS includes a suite of MPI unit tests using the testing infrastructure included in the GNU autotools build system
in order to check the functionality of the library's modules.

It consists of programs in the test_fms/ directory, with shell scripts to handle directory set up and input files.
test_lib.sh.in and tap-driver.sh provide additional helper functions used in the scripts and manage output.

### Running the Tests

1. Configure with autotools
```
mkdir build # create a build directory in FMS
autoreconf -if ../configure.ac
../configure <configure options>
```

2. Build and run suite
```
make check
```
This will compile any code not already compiled and then proceed to run the test scripts.

### Debugging Output and Test Options

Setting the environment variable TEST_VERBOSE will direct output to stdout as the test runs, while setting VERBOSE will only output on failure.
Logs are created for each test as well, with the name \<test script name\>.log in its corresponding test_fms/ directory.

To run an individual test:
```
make check -C test_fms/<test directory> TESTS=<test script name>
```

SKIP_TESTS can be set to in order to skip specific tests in a script. It uses the script name and test number, and takes ranges as well:
```
SKIP_TESTS="test_name.4 test_name.[1-3]"
```

Some options that effect the test suite can be set by passing options to the ./configure script that creates the makefiles
for the build system:

-    `--enable-code-coverage` allows for compilation with flags for coverage information.
     If enabled a coverage report can be generated with `make check-code-coverage`
-    `--enable-test-input=/path/to/input` turns on test scripts that require input netcdf files (interpolator, xgrid, data_override).
     This option is mainly used internally and in automated testing since we do not host the input data publicly.
-    `--with-yaml` compile with yaml input and enable its associated tests
