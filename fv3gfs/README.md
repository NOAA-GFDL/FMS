The fv3gfs directory within the FMS shared infrastructure is provided as 
a courtesy to NCEP/EMC. The directory contains the makefile used by the 
EMC workflow for building libfms.a, the fms library to be linked into 
the executable.  The inclusion of this directory and the contents within
allows NCEP/EMC to keep up to date with the latest development by 
accessing the FMS infrastructure as a sub-module directly from the FMS 
GitHub repository, maintained by GFDL.
