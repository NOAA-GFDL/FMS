!! \section DESCRIPTION
!!
!! Test the mpp_print_memuse_stats is functional, and prints to stderr, the default.
!! This test will allocate memory using two allocatable arrays, and print the memory
!! use statitics between each allocation.  The program should exit with status zero if
!! successful.  The script calling the program can check if the numbers are sane, if
!! desired.
