!> @brief Routines for creating Gaussian-shaped land surface topography
!! for latitude-longitude grids.
!> @author Bruce Wyman
!!
!! Interfaces generate simple Gaussian-shaped mountains from
!! parameters specified by either argument list or namelist input.
!! The mountain shapes are controlled by the height, half-width,
!! and ridge-width parameters.
